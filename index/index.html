As students we have always had troubles sharing our ebooks,
We always wanted to have something from where we can upload our books and share it.
Something where in students could upload their files and share it with others. So here we present you BookLovers.com 
Students can create their accounts and save their books which will stay on our cloud space,Every account will be granted a spae of 4Gb at the start which will be increased to 7gb once limit is reached.
As we are trying to keep our website free of ads any and all amount of donations are welcomed.
We can work together to provide a huge support to students and teachers by providing them free sharable ebooks.
