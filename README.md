##Lets call it "BookLover.com"
Okay sadly I am stuck with the project f web development I hate it. As simple as that I hate it and no hateful word is enough to describe my hate for webdevelopment
But then again I am stuck as I said so instead of whining lets create this test Website.
The website is more or less supposed to be available for renting and buying of books,available to us.
Users should be able to create account and upload there desired pdf/ebooks which will be shared/reneted to other users. 
People will have to pay a very nominal fee using credit card/whatev is available and then they will be able to download it or preferably the book will be sent to their email accounts.
